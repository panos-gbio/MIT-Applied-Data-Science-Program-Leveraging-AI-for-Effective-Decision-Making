# Capstone Project - Loan Default Analysis and Prediction 
## Where gene expression profiles and Loan default analysis meet

In this project, I analyzed the loan **loan default kaggle dataset**, and decided to add some new complexity to the analysis. I optimized a random forest based on recall and ROC auc 
metrics (0.82, 0.92), and after feature importance analysis I generated 2D profiles by performing dimension reduction to the dataset using the top 6 features. <br>
Originally based on gene expression profiles, the loan default 2d profiles are landscapes indicating the effect of each feature to the distribution of the (non-/)defaulter populations.
The aim of this approach is to illustrate hidden associations between features as well as to indicate which combination of feature better represent the trajectory towards defaulting a 
loan.
